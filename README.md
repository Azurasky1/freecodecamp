## Contributing

We are more than happy to accept external contributions to the project in the
form of feedback, bug reports and even better - pull requests :)

The following snippets are inspired by the
[freecodecamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges) so the
unit test are generated based on the Freecodecamp uses cases.

### Create new snippets

If you want to send your pull request with new snippets from the
[freecodecamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com):

*   Create a new JavaScript file named with the exercise name formatted in
[kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles)

[Node.js modular way](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)
